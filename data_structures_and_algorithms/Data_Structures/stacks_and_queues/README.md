# Stacks and Queues

## Challenge
create a stack and a queue with certain methods.
## Approach & Efficiency
I made a Node class and used it in two other classes, one for the stack and the other is the queque
## API
`push`:it will add a node to the top of the stack
`pop`: it will remove the top of the stack.
`enqueque`: it will add a node to the end of the queque.
`dequeque`: it will remove the first node of the queque.
`peek`: it will check what is the top node in the stack, or queue.
`is_empty`: it will check if the stack, or the queque is empty.
