# Trees

## Challenge
cresting a tree that can be traversed with 3 different methods and adding nodes using binary search.
## Approach & Efficiency
creating classes with methods 
## API
BinaryTree:
they will return the tree in this order:
- `pre_order`==> 
 root-->left-->right
- `in_order`==>
 left-->root-->right
- `post_order`==>
 left-->right-->root
BinarySearchTree:
`add`--> accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
`contains`-->  accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
`find_maximum_value`--> finds the maximum number the the tree assuming all the values are integers.
