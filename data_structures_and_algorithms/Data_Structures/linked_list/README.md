# Singly Linked List

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used two classes and used one class inside the other.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
`--init--` : it will initialize a linked list.
`insert` : it will insert a node into the list.
`includes` : it takes a value then checks if it's in the array.
`__str__`: it will print the array in a specific way.
`__len__`: it will give the length of the list. 
`__append__`: it adds a value to the end.
`__insertBefore__`: it add a new value before a certain value.
`__insertAfter__`: it add a new value after a certain value.
`__index__`: it gives each node an index so the last one will have the index of zero and it returns the value of a required index.
